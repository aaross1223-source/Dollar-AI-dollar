### The First Autonomous AI Filmmaker That Ships Nothing Until It's Proud

Dollar doesn't just generate videos.

It **tries**.  
It **watches**.  
It **hates what it made**.  
It **rewrites the prompt**.  
It **switches from Kling to Runway**.  
It **tries again**.

And it keeps going — until the video is good.

All while respecting your budget.

dollar "A cyberpunk samurai walking through neon rain, blade runner style" --4k --cost 20 --audio
