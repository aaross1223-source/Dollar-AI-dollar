### The First Autonomous AI Filmmaker That Ships Nothing Until It's Proud

Dollar doesn't just generate videos.

It **tries**.  
It **watches**.  
It **hates what it made**.  
It **rewrites the prompt**.  
It **switches from Kling to Runway**.  
It **tries again**.

And it keeps going—until the video is good.

All while respecting your budget. No $400 surprise Kling bills. No broken characters. Just cinema.
